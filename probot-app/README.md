# render-bpmn

![Build Status](https://github.com/pinussilvestrus/github-bpmn/workflows/ci/badge.svg)

A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that automatically renders BPMN files on GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.

## Setup

The application is connected to GitHub as a [GitHub app](https://developer.github.com/apps/). Get started by creating a GitHub app, either via the development setup or using [manual configuration steps](#manual-steps) as documented below.


### Automatic Development Setup

Checkout, install and run the application in development mode as shown below:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:pinussilvestrus/github-bpmn.git
cd probot-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Access the application on [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000). [Probot](https://probot.github.io/), the app framework used by the render-bpmn application, helps you to create your GitHub app. Give your app a unique name and remember it.

Once the setup completes probot writes the basic app configuration to the `probot-app/.env` file. Go to your app page on GitHub, fetch client ID and client secret and add these properties to the `.env` file as `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`, respectively.

__Note:__ on additional start after registering could be needed work properly, causing registering delays to the smee.io proxy.

### Manual Steps

[Create your GitHub app](https://github.com/settings/apps/new) and configure it according to the [provided app mainfest](../probot-app/app.yml).

Create a `.env` file with the required configuration variables as provided by GitHub. Use the [provided example](../probot-app/.env.example) as a starting point.
